# Simple Image Viewer

Project to learn the tcl/tk and Tkinter bindings .

## Packages needed :

- Pillow
- Tkinter (and tcl/tk)

## Use: 

- Just run main.py 
- Select the file menu 
- Select "Open folder" and select a folder with images (be sure you are in the folder). 

Try to scroll on image to resize. 

Change zoom min/max/ratio using Preferences menu.


## TODO:

- Add multiplatform support (only linux now).

- Internationalize.

- Add sanity checks

- Re-do the configuration system to be more direct 

- Correct scroll-bars (hide if no needed)

- Add suport to change the size and position (vertical/horizonal) 
of preview images

- Do the load of images async to avoid freeze on gui

- Fix scroll-zoom to be more smooth

- Add menu bar to primary image viewer to show '+' , '-' and others
buttons to help handle zoom.
